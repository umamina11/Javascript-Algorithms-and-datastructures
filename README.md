# Javascript-Algorithms-and-data structures
In this course, we have learnt the fundamentals programming concepts of javascript. 
The whole course is divided into 10 sections. 

# Basic Javascript
JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. 
It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by
all modern browsers. We will start with basic data structures like numbers and strings.

# ES6
ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript.
Because all significant browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are
interchangeable.
Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 
(ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write 
programs in ES5, JavaScript constantly evolves, and new features are released yearly.
ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language.

# Regular Expression
Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help 
programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful 
but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.

# Debugging 
Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.
Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from
running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behaviour, or logical errors where your 
code doesn't do what you intended.

# Basic DataStructure
Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. 
We already know some common JavaScript data structures â€” arrays and objects.
In this Basic Data Structures course, we learned more about the differences between 
arrays and objects and which to use in different situations. 

# Basic Algorithm Scripting
An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
To write a practical algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and 
think carefully about how to solve each part with code.

# Object Oriented programming
OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development 
process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do.

# Functional Programming 
Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, 
code is organized into smaller, essential functions that can be combined to build complex programs.

# Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
 the basics of algorithmic thinking, along with OOP and Functional Programming,
 test your skills with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges.
